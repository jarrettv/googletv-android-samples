Web to Native Sample App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This application is an example how you can develop an embedded web application
with native video playback.

The Android application is a relatively thin client. It handles the WebView
and video state, as well as passing any key presses into the Javascript.

The web application can playback video in both the Android client and in a
browser. The page is hosted on appengine, but consists of only static files
